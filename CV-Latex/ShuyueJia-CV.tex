\workitemstwo
{I was in a team that was responsible for building a salesman training system, which was a piece of insurance dialogue systems. During intern, I led the effort to create a \href{https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/Chinese-Chat-Title-NER-BERT-BiLSTM-CRF}{Chinese Chat Title Named Entity Recognition (NER)} via the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model, and then matched the formal name with the recognized title through rules. (NER Dataset: 30,676 samples, 96.73\% accuracy on 550 samples.)}
{I also assisted in testing the sales training review system, and integrated salesman’s dialogue according to different difficulty levels, in verifying the reliability of the system.}
